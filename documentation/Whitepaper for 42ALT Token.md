### **Whitepaper for 42ALT Token by Roberto Abril \- rabril-h**

---

#### **Abstract**

The 42ALT token is a blockchain-based digital asset created to incentivize and reward student achievements at 42 schools. By introducing a gamified economy, 42ALT motivates students to excel in their academic pursuits while fostering a collaborative and self-sustaining ecosystem. The token also aims to bridge the gap between academic success and real-world value by creating partnerships with external institutions, enabling token holders to exchange 42ALT for goods, services, and experiences.

#### **1\. Introduction**

42 schools are renowned for their innovative, student-driven learning model. The 42ALT token builds upon this foundation by creating an internal economy that rewards academic progress and collaboration. Leveraging the Polygon Amoy testnet, 42ALT is distributed to students based on their completion of Common Core project rings and other contributions within the community.

Initially deployed with a total supply of 42,000,000 tokens, 42ALT’s utility extends beyond the school environment, offering real-world value through strategic partnerships. By transforming achievements into tangible benefits, 42ALT incentivizes students to complete their education while fostering a sense of belonging and accomplishment.

#### **3\. Current State of the Project**

At its current stage, 42ALT includes:

1. **Token Creation**:
   - The 42ALT token has been deployed as an ERC-20 token on the Polygon Amoy testnet.
2. **Reward Mechanism**:
   - Tokens are distributed to students upon completing project rings in the Common Core.
3. **Front-End Application**:
   - A web-based platform connected to the 42 intranet enables students to log in using their 42 credentials and claim tokens directly to their wallets.

#### **4\. Roadmap**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Current Phase)**

- Launch 42ALT token on the Polygon Amoy testnet.
- Develop and deploy the front-end application for reward claiming.
- Test and refine the airdrop mechanism based on student performance.

**Phase 2: Expanding Internal Use (1-6 Months)**

- Integrate 42ALT directly into the 42 intranet system:
  - Automatically generate wallets for students upon enrollment.
  - Distribute airdrops in a manner similar to Altarian Dollars, but utilizing decentralized infrastructure on Polygon L2 solutions.
- Introduce an internal marketplace:
  - Enable students to trade services (e.g., mentorship, debugging assistance) using 42ALT.
  - Provide options to purchase academic resources (e.g., textbooks, software licenses).
- Implement staking rewards:
  - Students can stake tokens to unlock benefits such as priority access to resources or enhanced rewards.
- Conduct user feedback sessions to optimize usability and engagement.

**Phase 3: Building Real-World Value (6-18 Months)**

- **Transportation Partnerships**:
  - Collaborate with public transport authorities and ride-sharing companies to enable token payments for daily commutes.
  - Integrate with bike-sharing programs.
- **Meal Plans**:
  - Establish partnerships with local cafes and on-campus cafeterias to accept 42ALT for food purchases.
- **Tech and Supplies**:
  - Partner with retailers to allow purchases of tech equipment and academic supplies using 42ALT.
- Launch conversion mechanisms to fiat or other cryptocurrencies through integration with crypto exchanges.

**Phase 4: Community Engagement (18-24 Months)**

- Host hackathons, coding competitions, and events with 42ALT as entry fees and rewards.
- Develop a governance system:
  - Allow students to propose and vote on new features or allocation of token reserves.
- Organize sustainability initiatives where students earn tokens for contributing to eco-friendly projects on campus.

**Phase 5: Ecosystem Expansion (2-3 Years)**

- Transition to Polygon PoS or zkEVM chains:
  - Leverage Polygon PoS for lower transaction fees and higher scalability.
  - Explore zkEVM to integrate zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring enhanced privacy and efficiency for transactions as real-world partnerships expand.
- Form partnerships with:
  - Private housing providers to allow rent payments in 42ALT.
  - Wellness centers and gyms for memberships or sessions.
  - Public institutions for token use in community services.
- Enable cross-campus interoperability:
  - Facilitate collaborations between global 42 campuses using a unified 42ALT system.
  - Organize inter-campus competitions and reward systems.
- Expand token acceptance to entertainment venues, such as cinemas and theaters.

**Phase 6: Maturity and Scaling (3+ Years)**

- Develop APIs for seamless integration with external platforms, enabling broader adoption of 42ALT.
- Scale partnerships with major companies and public services to make 42ALT a widely recognized currency.
- Explore potential for a transition to a fully decentralized system governed by token holders.
