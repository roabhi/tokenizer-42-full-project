### **Whitepaper for 42ALT Token \- Roberto Abril Hidalgo \- rabril-h**

---

#### **Abstract**

The 42ALT token is a blockchain-based digital asset created to incentivize and reward student achievements at 42 schools. By introducing a gamified economy, 42ALT motivates students to excel in their academic pursuits while fostering a collaborative and self-sustaining ecosystem. The token also aims to bridge the gap between academic success and real-world value by creating partnerships with external institutions, enabling token holders to exchange 42ALT for goods, services, and experiences.

#### **1\. Introduction**

42 schools are renowned for their innovative, student-driven learning model. The 42ALT token builds upon this foundation by creating an internal economy that rewards academic progress and collaboration. Initially tested on the Polygon Amoy testnet, 42ALT is distributed to students based on their completion of Common Core project rings and other contributions within the community.

Initially deployed with a total supply of 42,000,000 tokens, 42ALT’s utility extends beyond the school environment, offering real-world value through strategic partnerships. By transforming achievements into tangible benefits, 42ALT incentivizes students to complete their education while fostering a sense of belonging and accomplishment.

- **Distribution Plan**:

  - **Airdrops for Academic Achievements**: 50% of total supply over five years.
  - **Incentive Pool for Events and Governance**: 20%.
  - **Staking Rewards**: 15%.
  - **Marketplace Liquidity**: 10%.
  - **Reserve for Expansion and Partnerships**: 5%.

- **Deflationary Mechanisms**:

  - A small portion of tokens spent in transactions may be burned to maintain scarcity.

#### **3\. Current State of the Project**

At its current stage, 42ALT includes:

1. **Token Creation**:
   - The 42ALT token has been deployed as an ERC-20 token on the Polygon Amoy testnet.
2. **Reward Mechanism**:
   - Tokens are distributed to students upon completing project rings in the Common Core.
3. **Front-End Application**:
   - A web-based platform connected to the 42 intranet enables students to log in using their 42 credentials and claim tokens directly to their wallets.

#### **4\. Roadmap**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Current Phase)**

- Launch 42ALT token on the Polygon Amoy testnet.
- Develop and deploy the front-end application for reward claiming.
- Test and refine the airdrop mechanism based on student performance.
- Conduct extensive testing on the Polygon Amoy testnet to ensure the functionality of staking mechanisms, airdrop distribution, and marketplace transactions.

**Phase 2: Preparing for Mainnet Launch (1-6 Months)**

- Establish key partnerships:
  - Apply for a Polygon Grant to fund initial transaction fees on the Polygon PoS mainnet.
  - Form alliances with local institutions in Nou Barris, Barcelona, such as nearby cafeterias, bike rental services, and public transport providers willing to accept 42ALT as payment.
  - Collaborate with Telefonica, a primary supporter of 42 in Spain, to back the project’s deployment.
- Integrate 42ALT directly into the 42 intranet system:
  - Automatically generate wallets for students upon enrollment.
  - Distribute airdrops in a manner similar to Altarian Dollars, but utilizing decentralized infrastructure on Polygon L2 solutions.
- Finalize staking mechanisms:
  - Define theoretical justification for staking based on students “staking” their time and effort in the Common Core.
  - Introduce rewards for staked tokens, such as priority access to educational resources, exclusive event participation, or enhanced voting power in governance.

**Phase 3: Mainnet Deployment and Real-World Value (6-18 Months)**

- Transition to the Polygon PoS mainnet:
  - Deploy 42ALT on a decentralized blockchain with low transaction fees and robust infrastructure.
  - Leverage partnerships to establish real-world utility in Nou Barris, Barcelona, as the initial testing ground.
- **Transportation Partnerships**:
  - Enable token payments for public transportation and bike-sharing programs.
- **Meal Plans**:
  - Partner with local cafes and on-campus cafeterias to accept 42ALT for food purchases.
- **Tech and Supplies**:
  - Collaborate with retailers to allow purchases of academic and technological equipment using 42ALT.
- Launch conversion mechanisms to fiat or other cryptocurrencies through integration with crypto exchanges.

**Phase 4: Community Engagement (18-24 Months)**

- Host hackathons, coding competitions, and events with 42ALT as entry fees and rewards.
- Develop a governance system:
  - Allow students to propose and vote on new features or allocation of token reserves.
- Organize sustainability initiatives where students earn tokens for contributing to eco-friendly projects on campus.

**Phase 5: Ecosystem Expansion (2-3 Years)**

- Transition to Polygon zkEVM:
  - Integrate zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy and efficiency in real-world transactions.
- Expand partnerships:
  - Form alliances with housing providers, wellness centers, gyms, and public institutions for broader token acceptance.
  - Facilitate cross-campus interoperability and competitions across global 42 schools.
- Expand token acceptance to entertainment venues, such as cinemas and theaters.

**Phase 6: Maturity and Scaling (3+ Years)**

- Develop APIs for seamless integration with external platforms, enabling broader adoption of 42ALT.
- Scale partnerships with major companies and public services to make 42ALT a widely recognized currency.
- Explore potential for a transition to a fully decentralized system governed by token holders.
